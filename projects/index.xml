Indeed, neural networks are often seen as black boxes that deliver great accuracy on average, but may unpredictably fail in some corner cases (adversarial examples, hallucinations). While the latter may be acceptable in non-critical applications, their presence is a case for concern in the aerospace, medical, and transportation domains.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Supermartingale Certificates</title><link>/projects/supermartingale-certificates-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/supermartingale-certificates-1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Dynamical systems are a useful language for many problems in AI: robots interacting with the world, learning-enabled controllers, optimization dynamics, epidemiological and economic simulators, and (more broadly) any process that evolves over time according to a known set of rules.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Neural Model Checking</title><link>/projects/neuralmc/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/neuralmc/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="why-model-checking"&gt;Why Model Checking?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans make mistakes—and so do the AI tools the mordern work-force increasingly rely on. Some slip-ups are trivial (a banner in the wrong place), while others can halt a service, sink a company, or even endanger lives. Traditional testing helps, but history shows that many disasters slipped through “good enough” test suites.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
